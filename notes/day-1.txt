4. OOP

HTML:
	markup language, which helps you create web app design
	composed of tags (<html>, <ul>, <div> etc.)
	tags/elements: 
			openning and closing tag
			<tag-name>		</tag-name>
	every tag will contain:
		another tag
		textual content

	*note: some tags might not conatin any of the above
		<meta> <= empty, self-closing tag
		old style: <meta />
		<meta charset='utf-8'>

	<p>
		sdhasdsakdjsajdlkASJDLKjalkj
	</p>

	<head>
		<title>
				Index
		</title>
	</head>

	attributes:
		more or less, every tag will have some properties, known as attributes
	attribute: name=value pair
	<p id="mainPara" style="width:100px">
		.....
	</p>

	*note: some attributes might not have values (since they have value which is same as that of the attribute name) and we use them directly just by attribute name
	<select multiple>
			<option selected="selected" disabled="disabled">--select--</option>
			or
			<option selected disabled>--select--</option>
			<option>Anil</option>
			<option>Sunil</option>
	</select>

	2 types of tags depending on how they display the content inside:
	a. in-line: in the same line
	b. block: one block of content will be separated from anothet block of content by new line (line-break)
