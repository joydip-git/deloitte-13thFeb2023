1. create an array to store values from 0 to 9 in arbitrary manner
2. filter the array for ONLY even numbers

Note: (yiu can't use built-in function of array to filter)
	create a function, where you can pass the array as an argument and that function will filter the array for even numbers and will return another array containing only those even numbers
	print the even numbers from the returned array (from the function)

function name(arr){
	//code to filter the array (arr) and return a fresh array with only even numbers from that array (arr)
}

const numbers = [....]
const evenNumbers = name(numbers)
