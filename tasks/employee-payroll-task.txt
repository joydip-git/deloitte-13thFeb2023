1. calculate salary of two types of employee in my company: Hr and Developer
Hr properties: Name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, gratuitypay
	methods: calculateSalary(){ return calculated-salary based on basic, da, hra and gratuity}

Developer properties: Name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, incentivepay
				 methods: calculateSalary(){ return calculated-salary based on basic, da, hra and incentive}

create a base class with common factors between the two types of employee
to avoid repeated code
create 2 objects of Hr and 2 objects of Developer
store the 4 objects in an array
filter the array to select the employees whose salary is more than 20000 and display their names
